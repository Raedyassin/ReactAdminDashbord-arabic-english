# 📊 Dashboard Project

This project is a small, beginner-friendly web application designed to enhance my skills in building interactive dashboards. It incorporates key features such as:

- 🌍 **Multi-language support**: Implemented using the **i18next** framework to enable switching between multiple languages.
- 🎨 **SASS for styling**: Utilized **SASS** to learn and apply advanced styling techniques and explore the advantages of using a CSS preprocessor.
- 🌑 **Dark Mode**: Added a toggleable Dark Mode for a better and customizable user experience.

## 🌟 Purpose

The main objective of this project was to learn and practice building user interfaces, managing states, and applying dynamic styles while working with local data. This application does not use any APIs and relies entirely on local data for simplicity and focus on front-end development.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Setting up a user-friendly **dashboard layout**.
- Managing **dark mode** functionality.
- Using **i18next** to handle multi-language translations efficiently.
- Applying **SASS** to organize and maintain clean, scalable styles.

This project reflects my growing journey as a developer and my determination to explore new tools and frameworks to create better user experiences.
